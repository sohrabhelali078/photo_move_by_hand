# photo_move_by_hand
During my undergraduate studies, I developed a hand gesture recognition project that enabled users to control a presentation — such as moving images— using only hand movements. The system used computer vision techniques to interpret gestures, demonstrating my interest in human-computer interaction and real-time software-hardware integration.
I presented this project at a symposium in December 2023 in kardan university.
